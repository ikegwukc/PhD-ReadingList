[The Discipline of Machine Learning by Tom M Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/pubs/MachineLearning.pdf)

This document provides a brief and personal view of machine learning. Good to think of this paper as a foundational paper for machine learning.

Overall endeavor of machine learning:  "How can we build computer systems that automatically improve with experience, and what are the fundamental laws that govern all learning processes?"

A more precise def described by Tom Mitchell. - A machine learns with respect to a particular task T, performance metric P, and type of experience E. This varies by how a researcher chooses T, P, and E.

"Machine Learning focuses on the question of how to get computers to program themselves from an experience with some inital structure."

There's another field that is related to machine learning which is human learning. How do human's learn? The results are less than that of stats.

Tom Mitchell also talks about applications of machine learning. Speech Recognition, computer vision, robot control, applications in physical sciences.

General future of Machine Learning according to Tom Mitchell: ""
